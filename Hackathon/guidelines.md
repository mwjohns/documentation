# Guidelines for running the ASF/ACM BGSU Hackathon

This document was created to keep track of guidelines for running a hackathon. Many of these ideas were originally provided by Nationwide Insurance's hackathon team. Note: While many sections are currently one line, they should grow as we gain experience with them.

*Update When:*
- A meeting takes place with industry partners in relation to the methods of running a hackathon.
- The year's annual hackathon has concluded and lessons have been learned.
- New lessons have been learned during the planning phase.

### Key points (1..5)
1. The more open the better
2. Focus should be on the fun, not the competition
3. Securing a venu should be the number one priority
4. Focus on creating working software and learning new tech over focusing on ideas

## Before the Hackathon

Notes regarding items that need to take place before the event. This includes announcing the event, registering participants, informational sessions, partnering with vendors, and preparing the venue.

### Announcing the event and registering participants

Event should be announced as soon as possible so people can plan accordingly. Registration can begin a few weeks before the event. The registration system does not have to be very fancy but can also be done with an application for larger events.

### Informational Sessions

Informational sessions provide an opportunity to let students up-skill before the event and become comfortable with vendor tools as well as what to expect.

The goal of informational sessions is to increase preparedness and decrease frustraction. Frustration leads to quitting and quitting leads to the dark side.
