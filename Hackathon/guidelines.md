# Guidelines for running a Hackathon

This document was created to keep track of guidelines for running a hackathon. Many of these ideas were originally provided by Nationwide Insurance's hackathon team. Note: While many sections are currently one line, they should grow as we gain experience with them.

*Update When:*
- A meeting takes place with industry partners in relation to the methods of running a hackathon.
- The year's annual hackathon has concluded and lessons have been learned.
- New lessons have been learned during the planning phase.

1. The more open the better
2. Focus should be on the fun, not the competition
3. Securing a venu should be the number one priority
4. Focus on creating working software and learning new tech over focusing on ideas
