# Guidelines for running the ASF/ACM BGSU Hackathon

This document was created to keep track of guidelines for running a hackathon. Many of these ideas were originally provided by Nationwide Insurance's hackathon team. Note: While many sections are currently one line, they should grow as we gain experience with them.

*Update When:*
- A meeting takes place with industry partners in relation to the methods of running a hackathon.
- The year's annual hackathon has concluded and lessons have been learned.
- New lessons have been learned during the planning phase.

### Key points (1..5)
1. The more open the better
2. Focus should be on the fun, not the competition
3. Securing a venu should be the number one priority
4. Focus on creating working software and learning new tech over focusing on ideas

## Before the Hackathon

Notes regarding items that need to take place before the event. This includes announcing the event, registering participants, informational sessions, partnering with vendors, and preparing the venue.

### Announcing the event and registering participants

Event should be announced as soon as possible so people can plan accordingly. Registration can begin a few weeks before the event. The registration system does not have to be very fancy but can also be done with an application for larger events.

### Informational Sessions

Informational sessions provide an opportunity to let students up-skill before the event and become comfortable with vendor tools as well as what to expect.

The goal of informational sessions is to increase preparedness and decrease frustraction. Frustration leads to quitting and quitting leads to the dark side.

### Vendor Partnerships

Many vendors are interested in helping hackers learn their technologies. They can provide:
- Resources
- Cloud Instances
- Representatives/Mentors at the event
- Workshops leading up to the event

### Venue requirements

How to verify the venue is sufficient:
- Load test the wifi
    - Additional access points
- Calculate bathroom to person ratio
- Check Maximum Capacity
- Check Amperage of building electricity
    - Check with school electrician to get access or have someone on call
    - People who run career fair may have power strips and cords

## Running the Hackathon

During the hackathon the goal is to create the best experience for the participants.

### Micro-Events

Have events going on during the hackathon. This can include video games, movies, snack carts, sponsor meet & greets, etc.

### Repositories

Repos should be given to each team at the beginning of the event so that they do not get a head start.

### Judging

The goal of judging is that 100% of participants believe that it was a fair process. This is one of the most difficult parts of running the hackathon. This process can also take a long time so ensure there are things to do throughout the judging process.

## After the Hackathon

Tasks to be completed post hackathon include:
- Send survey to participants to improve to coming year
- Review how the event went with sponsors
- Compile notes and make a plan of things to change the coming year
